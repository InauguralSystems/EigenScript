## Tutorial Roadmap

### [Tutorial 1: Your First Program](first-program.md)
**⏱️ 30 minutes** | **Difficulty: Beginner**

Learn the basics of EigenScript syntax and write your first programs.

**Topics:**
- Variables and assignment
- Basic I/O with `print` and `input`
- Simple arithmetic
- Running programs

**By the end:** You'll write a temperature converter and guessing game.

---

### [Tutorial 2: Recursive Functions](recursive-functions.md)
**⏱️ 45 minutes** | **Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate**

Master recursion and understand EigenScript's automatic convergence detection.

**Topics:**
- Function definition
- Recursive thinking
- Base cases and recursive cases
- Automatic convergence
- Self-reference

**By the end:** You'll implement factorial, Fibonacci, and tree traversal.

---

### [Tutorial 3: List Manipulation](list-manipulation.md)
**⏱️ 45 minutes** | **Difficulty: Intermediate**

Learn functional programming with lists and higher-order functions.

**Topics:**
- Creating and accessing lists
- Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
- List comprehensions
- Advanced list operations

**By the end:** You'll process data with functional programming patterns.

---

### [Tutorial 4: File Processing](file-processing.md)
**⏱️ 60 minutes** | **Difficulty: Intermediate**

Work with files, JSON data, and real-world data processing.

**Topics:**
- Reading and writing files
- JSON parsing and serialization
- CSV processing
- Error handling

**By the end:** You'll build a data processing pipeline.

---

### [Tutorial 5: Self-Aware Code](self-aware-code.md)
**⏱️ 60 minutes** | **Difficulty: Advanced**

Unlock EigenScript's unique self-awareness features.

**Topics:**
- Interrogatives (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, etc.)
- Predicates (converged, stable, etc.)
- Geometric semantics
- Meta-programming
- Self-hosting concepts

**By the end:** You'll create self-documenting, adaptive algorithms.

---

## Learning Path

### Complete Beginner

Start with **Tutorial 1**, then proceed in order through all tutorials.

### Some Programming Experience

Skim **Tutorial 1**, focus on **Tutorials 2-4**, then master **Tutorial 5**.

### Functional Programming Background

Jump to **Tutorial 3** for list operations, then **Tutorial 5** for unique features.

### Advanced/Research

Go directly to **Tutorial 5** and read the [Mathematical Foundations](../mathematical_foundations.md).

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Basic computer literacy
- Ability to edit text files
- EigenScript installed ([Installation Guide](../getting-started.md))

### Helpful (but not required)
- Programming experience in any language
- Familiarity with mathematical concepts
- Command line basics

## How to Use These Tutorials

### 1. Read Actively
Don't just read—type out the examples yourself.

### 2. Experiment
Modify examples to see what happens. Break things!

### 3. Do Exercises
Each tutorial has exercises. Try them before checking solutions.

### 4. Build Something
After each tutorial, build a small project using what you learned.

### 5. Review
Come back to earlier tutorials as you learn more.
