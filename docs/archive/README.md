# Historical Planning Documents

This directory contains historical planning, progress tracking, and status documents from EigenScript's rapid development phase (November 2025).

## Purpose

These documents were created during the initial 2-day development sprint and subsequent 4-week production polish phase. They are preserved for historical context and to show the project's evolution.

## Current Documentation

For current project status and plans, see:
- [/ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) - Current roadmap and future plans
- [/CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) - Version history and changes
- [/README.md](../../README.md) - Project overview and quick start

## Why So Many Documents?

During rapid development, multiple planning documents were created to:
1. Track progress across different timeframes (weekly, overall)
2. Reconcile different roadmap versions as priorities evolved
3. Provide status updates for different audiences
4. Document decision-making and trade-offs

This led to document proliferation, which is normal during rapid iteration. The consolidation into a single [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) provides a cleaner, forward-looking view.

## Learning from History

These documents show:
- **Rapid iteration**: From zero to production-ready in 4 weeks
- **Adaptive planning**: Roadmaps evolved as requirements became clear
- **Transparent progress**: Detailed weekly tracking of accomplishments
- **Honest assessment**: Including "HONEST_ROADMAP.md" showing real status

## Archive Policy

Documents are preserved but not actively maintained. They may contain:
- Outdated status information
- Superseded plans
- Completed tasks
- Historical decisions

For current information, always refer to the main project documentation.

**Note**: This archive demonstrates the messy reality of rapid software development - lots of planning documents, frequent pivots, and iterative refinement. The clean, consolidated roadmap emerged from this process.
