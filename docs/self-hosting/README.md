# Self-Hosting Documentation

This directory contains documentation about EigenScript's self-hosting capabilities - the ability for EigenScript to interpret its own code through a meta-circular evaluator.

## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting (or meta-circular evaluation) is when a programming language can be used to implement an interpreter for itself. This demonstrates that the language is sufficiently powerful and complete.
