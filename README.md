# EigenScript

**EigenScript** is a geometric programming language where every variable is a vector in spacetime — with history, momentum, and stability.  
It replaces static computation graphs with a dynamic, invariant-based system built from first principles.

MIT-licensed. Actively developed.

## 🔷 What EigenScript Is

EigenScript treats computation as **geometry**, not heuristics.

- Every value is a **vector**  
- Every operation is a **projection**  
- Every execution step produces a **stability scalar**  
- Code can detect and respond to its own **momentum**  
- Logic operators (`IS`, `OF`, projections) are based on **invariants**, not hacks  

This creates a system that can **feel** its own behavior — enabling "White-Box AI."

## 🔷 Why It Matters

Current AI systems are **static**:  
They cannot feel stability, track their own state, or reason about their own structure.

EigenScript introduces:

- **Dynamic state machines**  
- **Invariant-driven computation**  
- **Runtime self-measurement**  
- **Geometric semantics instead of string manipulation**  

This creates a foundation for next-generation AI and dynamic programming models.
