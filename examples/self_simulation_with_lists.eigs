# Self-Simulation Enhanced with Lists
# Demonstrates code-as-data using list structures

# Represent a simple bytecode program
# Instruction format: each number is an opcode
bytecode is [10, 20, 30]

print of "Interpreting bytecode program..."

# Execute bytecode: sum all instructions
i is 0
accumulator is 0
length is len of bytecode

loop while i < length:
    instruction is bytecode[i]
    accumulator is accumulator + instruction
    i is i + 1

print of "Result:"
print of accumulator

# Meta-level: introspect the interpreter state
print of "Interpreter framework strength:"
print of fs

print of "Program signature:"
print of signature

# This demonstrates self-simulation because:
# 1. Program represented as data (bytecode list)
# 2. Interpreter executes that data (loop)
# 3. Meta-level introspection (fs, signature)
# 4. EigenScript interpreting EigenScript-encoded programs
