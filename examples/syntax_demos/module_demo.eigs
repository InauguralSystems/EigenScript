# EigenScript Module System Demo
# This demonstrates the new import and member access syntax

# Import modules
import physics
import math as m

# Use imported module members
x is 10
gravity is physics.gravity
pi_value is m.pi

# Member access in expressions
y is physics.gravity + 1
z is m.pi * 2

# Chained member access (when nested modules are supported)
# deep_value is module.submodule.property
