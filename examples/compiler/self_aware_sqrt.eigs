define smart_sqrt as:
    guess is n / 2
    guess is (guess + n / guess) / 2
    guess is (guess + n / guess) / 2
    guess is (guess + n / guess) / 2
    guess is (guess + n / guess) / 2
    guess is (guess + n / guess) / 2
    
    if converged:
        print of 1
    else:
        print of 0
    
    return guess

result is smart_sqrt of 16
print of result
