define adaptive_sqrt as:
    guess is n / 2
    iterations is 0
    
    loop while not converged:
        guess is (guess + n / guess) / 2
        iterations is iterations + 1
        
        if diverging:
            print of 999
            return 0
    
    print of iterations
    return guess

result is adaptive_sqrt of 144
print of result
