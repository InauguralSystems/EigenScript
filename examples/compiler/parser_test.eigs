# Test EigenScript Self-Hosting Parser
# This file tests various parsing constructs

# Test 1: Simple assignment
x is 42
y is 3.14
name is "hello"

# Test 2: Binary operators with precedence
result is 1 + 2 * 3
result2 is (1 + 2) * 3

# Test 3: Comparison operators
test1 is x > 10
test2 is y <= 5
test3 is x = 42

# Test 4: Logical operators
bool1 is x > 0 and y < 10
bool2 is test1 or test2
bool3 is not test3

# Test 5: OF operator (relational)
value is print of x
# nested is func of arg of inner  # commented - would fail at runtime

# Test 6: List literals
numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
empty is []
mixed is [x, y, 42]

# Test 7: List indexing
first is numbers[0]
last is numbers[4]

# Test 8: Function definition
define add as:
    a is 1
    b is 2
    result is a + b
    return result

# Test 9: Conditional
if x > 10:
    print of "big"
else:
    print of "small"

# Test 10: Loop
i is 0
loop while i < 5:
    print of i
    i is i + 1

# Test 11: Nested structures
define factorial as:
    if n = 0:
        return 1
    else:
        sub is n - 1
        rec is factorial of sub
        return n * rec

# Test 12: Struct definition
struct Token:
    type
    value
    line
    column

# Test 13: Interrogatives
val is what is x
reason is why is x
method is how is x

# Test 14: Member access
result is module.function
nested is a.b.c

# Test 15: Multiple expressions
sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
product is 2 * 3 * 4
complex is (a + b) * (c - d) / e

# End of parser tests
print of "Parser test file loaded"
