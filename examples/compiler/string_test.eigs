# Test native string primitives for self-hosting
# These are the foundation for writing the lexer in EigenScript

# Test 1: String literals and length
source is "hello world"
len is string_length of source
print of len

# Test 2: Character access
first_char is char_at of [source, 0]
print of first_char

# Test 3: Character classification
digit_test is char_is_digit of 48
print of digit_test

alpha_test is char_is_alpha of 65
print of alpha_test

space_test is char_is_whitespace of 32
print of space_test

# Test 4: Substring
sub is substring of [source, 0, 5]
print of sub

# Test 5: String concatenation
hello is "hello"
world is " world!"
combined is string_concat of [hello, world]
print of combined

# Test 6: String comparison
equal_test is string_equals of [hello, hello]
print of equal_test

# Test 7: Number to string conversion
num is 42
num_str is number_to_string of num
print of num_str

# Test 8: String to number conversion
str_num is "123.456"
parsed is string_to_number of str_num
print of parsed
