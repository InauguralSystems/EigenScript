# Test user-defined types (structs) for self-hosting

# Define a simple struct
struct Point:
    x
    y

# Create an instance
p is Point of [10, 20]

# Access fields
px is p.x
py is p.y
print of px
print of py

# Define a more complex struct (like a token)
struct Token:
    type
    value
    line
    column

# Create a token
tok is Token of [1, 42, 10, 5]
print of tok.type
print of tok.line
