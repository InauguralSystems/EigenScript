# Test truthiness with scalar countdown
# This tests the ensure_bool() fix where a scalar is used directly as a condition
# Before the fix, this would crash with "cbranch expects i1, got double"

count is 10
sum is 0

# Using a scalar variable directly as a condition (not a comparison)
loop while count:
    sum is sum + count
    count is count - 1

print of sum
# Expected: 55 (10 + 9 + 8 + ... + 1)
