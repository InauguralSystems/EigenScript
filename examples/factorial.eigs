# Factorial function in EigenScript
# Demonstrates recursive function definition

define factorial as:
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        prev is n - 1
        sub_result is factorial of prev
        return n * sub_result

# Calculate factorial of 5
result is factorial of 5
print of result  # Should output: 120
