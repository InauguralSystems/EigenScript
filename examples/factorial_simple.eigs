# Simple factorial using correct EigenScript syntax
# Uses comparison operators rather than IS

define factorial as:
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        prev is n - 1
        sub_result is factorial of prev
        return n * sub_result

# Calculate factorial of 5
result is factorial of 5
print of result
